# Reflection
Creating my personal web portfolio and deploying it on GitHub Pages was a valuable learning experience that helped me better understand version control, web hosting, and responsive design. One of the main challenges I faced was organizing my project files correctly and ensuring the links worked after uploading them to GitHub. Initially, some images didn’t load properly because of incorrect file paths, but I solved this by carefully checking and adjusting relative paths to be consistent with the repository structure.

Another challenge was making the portfolio fully responsive. I tested my site on both desktop and mobile devices, then used CSS media queries to adjust layouts, font sizes, and image scaling for smaller screens. This helped improve the user experience and accessibility. I also ensured that images had meaningful alt text and that the color contrast met accessibility standards, making the content easier to read for all users.

I applied several UI/UX principles throughout the design: a clear visual hierarchy using headings and contrasting colors to guide users, simple navigation with a sticky top menu for easy access to different sections, and consistent spacing using CSS grid and containers to maintain alignment. The call-to-action buttons, such as “Explore Portfolio” and “Visit GitHub,” are clearly visible and encourage engagement.

In the future, I plan to improve the portfolio by adding interactive JavaScript features and optimizing load times. I also want to enhance the design with custom animations and include a downloadable resume for better professional presentation. Overall, this project strengthened my skills in web development and version control, preparing me for more complex projects ahead.



# Challenges Faced and Solutions
One of the biggest challenges I faced was managing file paths and ensuring all images and styles loaded correctly after uploading my project to GitHub. At first, some images were broken because I used incorrect relative paths. To fix this, I carefully reviewed the folder structure and updated all links to correctly reference files within the repository.

Another challenge was making the website fully responsive. Initially, the site looked good on desktop but did not display well on mobile devices. To solve this, I used CSS media queries to adjust layouts, font sizes, and image widths based on screen size. Testing on different devices helped me identify areas needing improvement.

I also encountered difficulty setting up GitHub Pages for deployment. Understanding how to connect my repository to GitHub Pages and configure the settings was confusing at first. I resolved this by following GitHub’s official documentation and tutorial videos, which guided me step-by-step through the process.

Finally, ensuring accessibility was a new experience. I learned to add alt text for images and choose color contrasts that met accessibility standards, which improved the site’s usability for all users.

Overall, these challenges helped me deepen my understanding of web development and version control, and I am confident in applying these skills to future projects.



# Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to enhance my portfolio by adding more interactive features using JavaScript, such as animations, dynamic content filtering, and form validations to improve user engagement. I also want to optimize the website’s performance by compressing images and minimizing CSS and JavaScript files to reduce loading times.

Additionally, I aim to improve the design by incorporating a more cohesive color scheme and adding custom fonts to enhance visual appeal and brand identity. Making the navigation menu fully responsive with a mobile-friendly hamburger menu would also improve usability on smaller devices.

To increase accessibility, I will implement better keyboard navigation and ARIA roles, ensuring the site is fully usable by people with disabilities. Including a downloadable resume and links to social media profiles will make it easier for potential employers or clients to connect with me.

Finally, I want to keep the portfolio updated regularly with new projects and experiences to showcase my growth as a developer and designer.
